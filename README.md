# ArchRival

![ArchRival Logo](logo.png)

> *A clean SystemVerilog implementation of the ICMC-Processor — redesigned at UNICAMP.*

**ArchRival** is a modernized and modular reimplementation of the [ICMC-Processor](https://github.com/simoesusp/Processador-ICMC/), originally designed by students and faculty from the University of São Paulo (USP). Developed from scratch with clarity, portability, and educational value in mind, this project brings the architecture into a new era — with upgraded structure, refined RTL code, and a layout that cleanly supports multiple FPGA and ASIC targets.

### 🏁 Key Goals

- Replace ugly and verbose VHDL with clean, readable SystemVerilog.  
- Organize the codebase by separating design, verification, and target-specific files.  
- Make the platform suitable for teaching and experimentation.  
- Celebrate UNICAMP's champion-level commitment to computing education.
