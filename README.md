# ArchRival

![ArchRival Logo](assets/banner.svg)

**ArchRival** is a small and modular SoC + CPU core that implements the [ICMC-Processor](https://github.com/simoesusp/Processador-ICMC/)'s ISA, developed from scratch with maintainability, portability, and educational value in mind.

---

## Key Goals

- Write a clean and readable SystemVerilog implementation.
- Organize the codebase by separating design, verification, and target-specific files.
- Document every aspect of the processor's design, architecture, and the ISA.
- Maintain compatibility with original ICMC-Processor.
- Make the platform suitable for teaching and experimentation, by allowing easy addition of new features.
